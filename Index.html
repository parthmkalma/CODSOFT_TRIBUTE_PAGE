                    <p class="mb-4">Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer and
                        the current captain of the Indian national cricket team across all formats. A right-handed
                        batsman, Sharma is widely regarded as one of the best batsmen of his generation and one of the
                        greatest opening batsmen of all time. He is renowned for his timing, elegance, six-hitting
                        abilities, and leadership skills.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Sharma holds several significant batting records, including:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                        <li>Most sixes in international cricket</li>
                        <li>Most double centuries in ODI cricket (3)</li>
                        <li>Most centuries in Cricket World Cups (7)</li>
                        <li>Joint most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (6)</li>
                        <li>First player to score 6 T20I centuries</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-4">He plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL and represents Mumbai in domestic
                        cricket. Under his captaincy, the Mumbai Indians won the IPL titles in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019,
                        and 2020, making him the most successful captain in IPL history, a record he shares with MS
                        Dhoni.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Sharma was part of the Indian team that won the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2013 ICC
                        Champions Trophy, playing in the finals of both tournaments. He is one of four players to have
                        participated in every edition of the ICC T20 World Cup, from the inaugural 2007 edition to the
                        latest in 2022.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Rohit Sharma holds the world record for the highest individual score (264) in a One
                        Day International (ODI) match and is the only player to have scored three double centuries in
                        ODIs. He also holds the record for the most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup,
                        earning him the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year award in 2019.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">He has been honored with two national awards: the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the
                        prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award in 2020 by the Government of India. Under his
                        leadership, India won the 2018 and 2023 Asia Cups, both in the ODI format, and the 2018 Nidahas
                        Trophy in T20I format.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Beyond cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He is the
                        official Rhino Ambassador for WWF-India and a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of
                        Animals (PETA). He has worked with PETA to raise awareness about the plight of homeless cats and
                        dogs in India.</p>

                            Cricket World Cup
                            saw him become the first player to score five centuries in a single edition of the
                            tournament. His runs were
                            crucial for India's campaign in reaching the semi-finals.</p>

                        <p class="text-sm mt-2 text-gray-600">During the 2019 Test series against South Africa, Rohit
                            Sharma set a
                            record for hitting the most sixes in a Test series. His aggressive batting style and ability
                            to clear the
                            boundary consistently made him a formidable batsman in the series.</p>

                        <p class="text-sm mt-2 text-gray-600">Rohit Sharma's record-breaking century against Sri Lanka
                            in 2017 is the
                            fastest century by an Indian in T20 Internationals. His innings included an array of
                            powerful shots and
                            showcased his ability to dominate the opposition bowlers.</p>

                            instrumental in
